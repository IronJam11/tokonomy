# Tokonomy

**Create coins from conversations — AI-powered token generation built on the Zora protocol.**

Tokonomy reimagines the way tokens are created. Instead of filling out technical forms or writing smart contracts, users simply express their ideas, emotions, or strategies — and our AI agents handle the rest. Whether you're a creator with a vision, a user with a feeling, or a strategist chasing trends, Tokonomy turns your input into real, deployable tokens using Zora’s CoinV4 infrastructure.

Deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** for lightning-fast performance and seamless user experience.

## The Problem

Traditional social platforms extract all the value created by the people who power them.

* Creators struggle to monetize directly.
* Supporters give attention and receive nothing in return.
* Platforms and advertisers win — users lose.

### Tokonomy changes the model:

It enables **direct exchange of value** between creators and supporters. Now, a thought, a rant, or a well-researched idea can become a token — with measurable, tradeable impact.

## Key Features

### AI-Driven Token Creation Workflows

**Tokonomy offers three specialized AI agents to help you create tokens in different ways:**

#### Tokebot Sonnet — Parameter-Based Coin Creation

Designed for users who want to describe their coin explicitly.

* Describe coin properties via chat
* Search existing coins and profiles
* Get basic predictive analysis on your idea
* Launch tokens directly on-chain

#### Tokebot Mood — Emotion-Based Token Generation

Speak your mind. The bot interprets emotional content and generates a full token configuration.

* Convert free-flowing thoughts into token logic
* One-click minting
* Mood-to-market analysis for fit and success

#### Tokebot Prompt — Research & Trend Optimizer

Input a prompt. Prompt analyzes market trends and tailors the coin for virality.

* Research-driven coin creation
* Trend and competition analysis
* Optimizes for market attention and impact

* No-code deployment of smart contracts
* Direct minting on Zora via SDK
* Auto-listing for tradability via Uniswap
* Real utility from day one

## Why It Matters

Tokonomy is more than a project — it's a protest.
It reclaims digital value for the people who create it. By letting anyone mint meaning — through words, feelings, or prompts — Tokonomy offers a radically open way for communities to build value **on their own terms**.

We believe the next wave of creator tools will be conversational, expressive, and decentralized. Tokonomy is our contribution to that future.
